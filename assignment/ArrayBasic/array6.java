/*
 6] Elements in the Range

Given an array arr[] containing positive elements. A and B are two numbers
defining a range. The task is to check if the array contains all elements in the given
range.

Example 1:
Input: N = 7, A = 2, B = 5
arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}
Output: Yes

Explanation: It has elements between range 2-5 i.e 2,3,4,5

Example 2:
Input: N = 7, A = 2, B = 6
arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}
Output: No

Explanation: Array does not contain 6.

Note: If the array contains all elements in the given range then driver code outputs
Yes otherwise, it outputs No

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^7
